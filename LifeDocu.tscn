Morning trip to the front garden.

Household activities.

Kitchen exhaust on for 34 minutes from 11:40 AM to 12:14 PM. 

P.I.’s note: I got close to the house and near the gas fan exhaust. Dang, her cooking smells so good! I really want to get some myself. I wonder if I can knock on her door and ask for some… 

Another kitchen exhaust for 55 minutes from 5:01 PM to 5:56 PM.
Dining room and kitchen lights on from 5:20 PM. 

P.I. thinks Grandma’s dinner smells even better than her lunch. How delightful! 

Living room lights on at 6:47 PM.
Living room, kitchen, and dining room lights off at 10:00 PM.
Stairwell lights on at 10:00 PM.
Bedroom lights on at 10:01 PM.
Bedroom lights off at 11:27 PM.

P.I.’s note: It’s safe to say that she went asleep, which ends my investigation. Hey Q, I really want to have your grandma’s cooking. You have never told any of us about how good her food is!
