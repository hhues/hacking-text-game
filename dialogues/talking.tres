H: Hey hey, good morning, ready for your first job? My name is H.
Q: My name is Q, nice to meet you, [PN].
H: We are HQ, ready to give you any instructions and aid. Things can be a bit difficult at times.
H: You will be taking on all sorts of jobs from all sorts of different clients, how exciting! 
H: But just for today, you are going to help us. Well, to be more precise, Q needs your help.
Q: Look at you, being all smirky. 
Q: But yeah. Today’s job is on my request. 
Q: My grandma hasn’t used her computer for a while, and she couldn’t remember the password.
Q: So your job is to gain root access to her computer and change the password.
Q: You are going to activate the “forgot password” program and try to convince the computer that you are the user herself.
H: And to convince the computer, you need to have as much knowledge as possible on the subject.
H: After all, the program is designed to let the real user in by asking them questions only they can answer.
H: But this is where we come in. We did a preliminary investigation and created a day-in-the-life report for Grandma. 
H: You can answer those questions using the report.
Q: Since her computer is pretty old, the program is very weak and easy to get past. There won’t be any difficult questions for today’s job.
H: But Q, why don’t you just ask Grandma these questions yourself?
Q: Ah… If we did that, it would take all day and we still won’t be done with question one.
Q: Once you get her going, she will go on tangents forever. I just don’t want to deal with her these days.
Q: I don’t have the time to chat. The yearly bonus is coming up and I need to take on as many clients as I can.
Q: But I’m sure we can do this in a jiffy and we’ll be out of here.
H: Fair enough. So, [PN], boot up the console and let’s get started.

~ q1_help1
H: Here you input “y” to tell the computer that you forgot the password.

~ q1_help2
H: This should be pretty easy. Skim through the report and find the answer.

~ q3_help1
Q: We know that she watered some flowers, but we don’t know what flowers they are…
Q: No worries, you can investigate something further by highlighting parts of the document that you want our private investigators to look into.
Q: Then click the phone icon at the bottom-right of the screen to start an investigation.
H: Our P.I.s will bring whatever information they can find on this matter. 

~ q3_help2
Q: Now you have the picture of flowers, you can use the magnifying glass icon to do some research.
H: Click on the flowers after selecting the magnifying glass to quickly look up what they are.

~ q4_help1
Q: We are close! You can do it. Remember the things we have taught you.
H: And especially the things I’ve taught you.
Q: What?

~ ending
Q: Nice work, [PN]. I think you are ready for this job. 
Q: Kinda curious why she bought a cake though, and such a big and expensive one at that.
Q: I do love strawberries though.
H: Oh Q… 
Q: What?
Q: Hold on, a phone call.
Q: Hello?
Grandma: Hey Q! Am I bothering you?
Q: No grandma, I just wrapped up work for the day.
Grandma: That’s great. Just asking if you have any time tomorrow to swing by. 
Grandma: I know you are busy and all, and you even managed to fix my computer despite all that.
Q: Well you see…
Grandma: And it’s your birthday tomorrow! I thought we could celebrate it together.
Q: I forgot that my birthday is tomorrow…
Grandma: It’s fine if you don’t make it. I know you are so busy nowadays, but it’s sad to see this cake go to waste.
Grandma: You see, it was on sale for senior’s discount Wednesdays at Sole Foods. 
Grandma: I know you love strawberries and all, so I bought it right away without much thinking.
Q: I do love strawberries, Grandma. Um… I guess I’ll see you tomorrow.
Grandma: That’s wonderful! 
H: Hey Q’s Grandma, mind if a few of us come along as well?
Grandma: Oh if it isn’t H! Sure thing, the more the merrier. I am going to put on some good cooking. All the food you like!
Grandma: See you tomorrow then! I’ll be waiting.
Q: …
H: [PN], you better get ready for Grandma Q’s cooking. It truly is amazing.
H: And happy birthday, Q.
H: And thank you for playing this Game Jam submission!
